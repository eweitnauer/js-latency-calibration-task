# JS Latency Estimation

This is a tracking task that estimates the device latency in the `js => display => touch => js` chain. This is useful when recording reaction times in javascript-based experiments.

We have implemented several task variations:

- track a moving circle with touch or mouse (test it [here](https://graspablemath.com/projects/js-latency/touch.html)).
- time crossing bars with clicks or spacebar (test it [here](https://graspablemath.com/projects/js-latency/keyboard.html))

This work is supported by Josh de Leeuw and [jsPsych](http://www.jspsych.org/).
