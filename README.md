# JS Latency Estimation

This is a tracking task that estimates the device latency in the `js => display => touch => js` chain. This is useful when recording reaction times in javascript-based experiments.

Test the estimation task [here](https://graspablemath.com/projects/js-latency/).

This work is supported by Josh de Leeuw and [jsPsych](http://www.jspsych.org/).
